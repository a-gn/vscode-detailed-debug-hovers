Keep the design document at `./DESIGN.md` up to date when you make changes. The goal of that document is to help AI coding agents work on the codebase. Keep it clean and short, keep the information you think will be most useful to a new AI agent session when starting up.

When you're done with a self-contained change, compile, test, commit, then push.
